# UI Section Vocabulary

Use this reference when turning screenshots, mockups, or app references into
clickable demos. The main job is to name what is on the screen before deciding
whether it belongs in code or in `image2`.

For a searchable version with local screenshots, anatomy, variants, related
terms, and copyable Agent prompts, open the [illustrated UI vocabulary](../vocabulary.html).

## Core Rule

Describe UI by role, not by vague appearance.

- Weak: "a row of boxes"
- Better: "filter chips above a card grid"
- Weak: "a floating thing"
- Better: "bottom sheet with a dimmed scrim"
- Weak: "some image cards"
- Better: "masonry gallery with media tiles and code-rendered captions"

## Page Anatomy

| Pattern name | What it means | Usually code-rendered? | image2 candidate? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App shell | The persistent frame around an app: nav, content region, safe area | Yes | No |
| Top app bar | Header with title, back/menu/search/actions | Yes | No |
| Navigation bar | Website-level links and primary actions | Yes | No |
| Sidebar | Vertical navigation or workspace list | Yes | No |
| Rail navigation | Compact icon-only side nav | Yes | No |
| Bottom tab bar | Mobile destinations at the bottom edge | Yes | No |
| Hero section | First major page moment, often text plus media | Text and controls yes | Media yes |
| Content section | A full-width page band with one job | Yes | Sometimes |
| Footer | Secondary links, contact, license, legal | Yes | No |

## Controls

| Pattern name | Use it for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Button | A direct command | Include hover, active, disabled, and loading states |
| Icon button | A compact command with an icon | Must have accessible name |
| Segmented control | Mutually exclusive view modes | Good for "Grid / List" or "Light / Dark" |
| Tabs | Switching related panels in the same context | Keep tab labels short |
| Filter chips | Narrowing a collection | Good for library, shop, search, and gallery screens |
| Search field | Querying local or remote content | Include empty and no-results states |
| Checkbox | Multiple independent binary choices | Label text sits next to the box |
| Toggle | A single on/off setting | Use for persistent settings |
| Slider | Numeric range control | Show current value when precision matters |
| Stepper | Small numeric increments | Good for quantity and spacing controls |
| Menu | Overflow actions or option sets | Avoid hiding primary actions in menus |
| Tooltip | Names unfamiliar icons | Do not put essential instructions only in a tooltip |

## Content Blocks

| Pattern name | What it looks like | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Card grid | Repeated cards in rows and columns | Products, articles, templates, examples |
| Bento grid | Mixed-size tiles with hierarchy | Feature tours, capability summaries |
| Masonry grid | Staggered cards with different heights | Visual galleries and inspiration boards |
| Feed list | Chronological or ranked rows | News, updates, activity, messages |
| Media tile | Image or video first, text second | Portfolio and visual libraries |
| Product card | Product image, name, price, action | Commerce and catalog screens |
| Stat strip | Compact numeric summary | Real metrics, counts, audits |
| Comparison table | Row-by-row feature comparison | Plans or technical differences |
| Detail panel | Rich information about the selected item | Inspectors, file details, product details |
| Timeline | Ordered events over time | Releases, history, onboarding |
| Stepper flow | Multi-step process with progress | Setup, checkout, forms |

## Overlays And Temporary Surfaces

| Pattern name | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modal | Interrupts with a focused task | Needs focus trap and close behavior |
| Drawer | Slides from the side for navigation or detail | Good for responsive layouts |
| Bottom sheet | Mobile-friendly panel from bottom edge | Often paired with a scrim |
| Popover | Small contextual surface near a trigger | Good for lightweight options |
| Command palette | Keyboard-first action/search overlay | Usually opens with Command K |
| Toast | Transient feedback | Do not use for persistent errors |
| Banner | Persistent message near page top | Good for warnings, trials, or sync state |

## State Vocabulary

| State name | When it appears | Implementation hint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loading skeleton | Before content arrives | Match the final layout shape |
| Empty state | A collection has no items yet | Offer one clear next action |
| No-results state | Search or filters match nothing | Keep current query visible |
| Error state | A request or action failed | Explain recovery, add retry when possible |
| Disabled state | An action is unavailable | Explain why when it is not obvious |
| Selected state | One item is active | Use contrast, not only color |
| Hover state | Pointer is over an interactive element | Use transform or color, not layout shift |
| Pressed state | Button is being activated | Small physical feedback works well |
| Focus state | Keyboard focus is present | Must be visible and high contrast |
| Success state | Action completed | Keep it brief and reversible when needed |

## Asset Split Names

Use these labels in `code-ui` and `image2-assets` inventories.

| Label | Goes to | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code-text` | Code | Headings, body copy, labels, prices |
| `code-control` | Code | Buttons, tabs, inputs, sliders |
| `code-icon` | Code | Search, back, close, menu, heart, play |
| `code-status` | Code | Battery, Wi-Fi, signal, progress, badges |
| `layout-chrome` | Code | Device frame, safe area, app shell |
| `photo-asset` | image2 | Lifestyle photo, hero photo, editorial cover |
| `product-cutout` | image2 | Object on transparent or clean background |
| `texture-asset` | image2 | Paper, glass, fabric, wall, gradient-like material |
| `illustration-asset` | image2 | Character, map, complex scene |
| `thumbnail-asset` | image2 | Card cover, article image, gallery tile |

## Pattern Recipes

- Sidebar or category rail
- Search field
- Filter chips or category buttons
- Stat strip
- Card grid, masonry grid, or media tiles
- Detail drawer or preview modal
- Empty state and no-results state

### Mobile Product Detail

Use when one object or place is the focus.

- Device frame and safe area

- Hero media or product cutout
- Title block
- Price or metadata row
- Segmented detail tabs
- Sticky bottom action bar
- Related card rail

### Editorial Feed

Use when the screen is about reading and discovery.

- Top app bar
- Topic tabs
- Featured story card
- Feed list
- Media tiles
- Bookmark and share icon buttons
- Loading skeleton
- No-results state

### Dashboard-Lite Overview

Use when the screen needs metrics but is not a dense admin tool.

- Header toolbar
- Stat strip
- Insight cards
- Chart panel
- Activity feed
- Filters
- Empty, loading, and error states

## Naming Checklist

Before implementation, write a short inventory:

```text
code-ui:
- app shell
- top app bar
- search field
- filter chips
- masonry card grid
- detail drawer
- empty state

image2-assets:
- hero media: 1600x900 photo-asset
- card covers: 4 thumbnail-assets, 4:3 crop
- object cutout: transparent product-cutout
```

If the inventory includes "image with text," split it again. Text belongs in
code unless it is part of a real photograph, scanned document, or artwork.
